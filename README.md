# KeySwap 

## Description

KeySwap is a PGP key exchanging application for Android which uses NFC to exchange PGP public keys between two parties.

It was worked on as a Hackathon project at Lookout as a proof of concept. Right now it works to send and receive keys
and the interfaces are in place to do key signing but the backend is not yet implemented to that yet.

## Dependencies

KeySwap relies on [GnuPG for Android](https://github.com/guardianproject/gnupg-for-android) to be installed for it to work.
It also presently requires Ice Cream Sandwich (4.x) or higher to be installed for it to work.
